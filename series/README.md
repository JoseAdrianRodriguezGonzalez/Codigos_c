# Series
One of the most common ways to sutdy  mathematicla algorithms is calculating a value forma a trascendental function determined by its Taylor-Mcclaurin's series.

By instance, we have to remember the formula.

$$\Sigma^{n}_{i=0} \frac{f^{(i)}(0)\cdot x^i}{i!}$$

Using this formula we can know the proper Taylor-Mcclaurin's series from each function.
We have some examples that could be useful to know when we are going some of them here at the C code

>[!NOTE]
>$$\sin(x)=\Sigma^{n}_{i=0}  \frac{(-1)^{2\cdot i+1}\cdot x^{2\cdot i+1}}{(2\cdot i+1)!}$$
